"# Binary-Search-Tree"

Binary Search Tree Implementation in C++

This program demonstrates the implementation of a binary search tree (BST) in C++. The BST is implemented using a custom class MyBinaryTree, which provides functionality for insertion, searching, and printing of nodes in the tree.

The MyBinaryTree class inherits from an abstract base class BinaryTree, which defines the basic interface for binary tree operations. The program also includes classes for node representation (node) and queue implementation (ArrayQueue).

In the main function, an instance of MyBinaryTree is created, and various nodes are inserted into the binary tree using the insert method. The tree is then traversed using both breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms. Additionally, the program demonstrates searching for a specific key in the tree.

The MyBinaryTree class provides a method print to visualize the structure of the binary tree. Nodes are printed with indentation to represent the hierarchical relationship between parent and child nodes. Each node is labeled with its value, and child nodes are labeled as "L" for left child and "R" for right child.

Overall, this program serves as a practical demonstration of implementing and working with binary search trees in C++, showcasing fundamental operations and tree traversal techniques.
